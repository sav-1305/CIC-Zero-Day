# Hybrid Machine Learning model for Zero-Day Threat Detection

This project implements a hybrid machine learning pipeline for detecting zero-day attacks in network traffic.
It utilizes an autoencoder for benign behaviour modelling and an XGBoost Classifier for anomaly detection. The project has been wrapped 
in a RESTful API with successful implementation of key-authentication, logging, and rate-limiting.

## Features 
- Data was trained on an improved version of the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset for NIDS optimization.
- `model_training.ipynb` defines the hybrid model architecture and preprocessing steps.
- `model_eval.ipynb` validates the performance of the hybrid model on a test-dataset composed of unknown attacks and benign traffic data.
- `inference.py` serves as the real-time inference method for RESTful API calls. `app.py` defines the REST API implemented through FastAPI 
for calling real-time inference on input traffic.
- `simulate_client.py` is a testing script implemented to iterate through a test-dataset and POST to the model API in real-time. `rate_limiter.py` is the script for request management and thresholding.
- A dashboard developed using streamlit (`dashboard.py`) that summarizes the traffic predictions generated by the model API when called on by `simulate_client.py`.
- `auth.py` introduces API-key authentication to the API calling method.
